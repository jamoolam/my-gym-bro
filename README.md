Fitness web application that can curate workouts, track calories, as well as be an encyclopedia for any and all gym-related questions and strategies

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, TailwindCSS, JavaScript, Express, MongoDB

I believe that as developers, we should always be playing to our strengths, as this will not only make our code more effecient, but also allows us to enjoy the process significantly more. That being said, I utilized TailwindCSS as a means to create an effective user-interface that is attractive enough for users to enjoy using, as I myself am very much design-deficient and lacking in those adjacent departments. However, the real meat and potatoes of the application (food pun, hah!) lies in the backend, where I used Express as the framework of choice, as it makes dealing with the server-side code simple, effective, and effecient. This is where most of the heavy lifting is done in terms of the code, as well as where I plan to spend most of my time for refactoring and implementing new features. 

## Optimizations

In it's current iteration, the application can only pull data from a hard-coded list of food items, as well as pull from a hard-coded list of wokrouts. However, with more time I plan on adding many more features to my project, as well as upscale all exisiting features. For example, I intend for the aforementioned hard-coded lists to be replaced by API's such as the Calorie King (https://www.calorieking.com/us/en/developers/food-api/), to allow for more options as well as even more data for users to gain access to and utilize for their needs. I also fully intend to add new features, as well as make the existing project run as smoothly as possible.

## Lessons Learned:

No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. With more time spent working on my passion project, it means more opportunities to fail and grow as a developer! So far in the process, I've learned that we developers are responsible for some of the most minute of details that consumers have no second thoughts about, such as query parameters, making sure our code runs effectively and constantly updating it with the latest in optimizing our codebases. As I continue to work on this, I will be updating this with all the new things I've learned on the journey of making this a phenomonal application! 

## Examples:
